## 4 - Precision, Repeatability, Accuracy

### Precision

Resolution, smallest move robot can make

### Repeatability

A measure of the ability of the robot to position the tool tip in the same place repeatedly

### Accuracy

A measure of the ability of the robot to place the tool tip at an arbitrarily prescribed location

## 5 - Degree of Freedoms

position could be changed by prismatic joints and revolute joints

but the orientation could only be changed by revolute joint

**For a structure with n joints to have n DOF, these n joints must be linear independent**

**In 3D space, the maximal number of linear independent direction is 6**
